##1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`.
select * from actor;
select first_name from actor;
select last_name from actor;

##1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`.
select concat(first_name, " ", last_name) from actor;

##2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
select upper(concat(first_name, " ", last_name)) as Actor_Name from actor;
alter table actor
drop column Actor_Name;
select * from actor;
select first_name, last_name, actor_id from actor
where first_name="Joe";

where last_name like "%LI%"
order by last_name, first_name;

select * from actor;

##2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China
select country_id, country from country
where country in ("Afghanistan", "Bangladesh", "China");

##3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so create a column in the table `actor` named `description` and use the data type `BLOB` (Make sure to research the type `BLOB`, as the difference between it and `VARCHAR` are significant).
alter table actor 
add column Description blob last;

##3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the `description` column.
alter table actor
drop column Description;

select * from actor;

##4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
select last_name, count(last_name)
from actor group by last_name;

from actor group by last_name having count(last_name)>=2
order by frequency asc;

##4c. The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`. Write a query to fix the record.
update actor
set first_name="HARPO"
where (first_name="Groucho" and last_name="Williams");

select first_name from actor
where last_name="Williams";

##4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`.
update actor
set first_name="GROUCHO"
where first_name="HARPO";

select first_name from actor
where last_name="Williams";

where payment_date like "2005-08%" group by first_name, last_name;

join customer on payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id group by payment.customer_id order by last_name asc;

##7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters `K` and `Q` have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters `K` and `Q` whose language is English.
